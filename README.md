AMATEUR SATELLITE FREQUENCY COORDINATION REQUEST INSTRUCTIONS AND APPLICATION FORM
1.	Amateur-satellite service:  Amateur stations meet the requirements of the radio regulations , RR 1.56. and 1.57.
RR 1.56 	amateur service: A radiocommunication service for the purpose of self-training, intercommunication and technical investigations carried out by amateurs, that is, by duly authorized [licensed] persons [individual natural people] interested in radio technique solely with a personal aim [for themselves] and without pecuniary interest [compensation].  (NOTE: Explanatory terms in brackets are not part of the treaty text.)
RR 1.57 	amateur-satellite service: A radiocommunication service using space stations on earth satellites for the same purposes as those of the amateur service.
Before asking for help from IARU with frequency coordination in the amateur-satellite service, make sure that your proposed operation meets the treaty requirements.  NOTE: “Without pecuniary interest” means that you may accept free will donations of goods and services, that is, with nothing required in return.  You may not sell services or data to anyone for any reason.
Ultimately, the decision of whether the proposed operation is appropriate for the amateur-satellite service rests with your country’s administration (your national telecommunication regulator).  Therefore, before sending your frequency coordination request to IARU, we suggest that you consult with your administration to determine whether the amateur-satellite service or another radiocommunication service is appropriate for your operation.
2.	Self-coordination.  For over 100 years, amateur radio operators have maintained an effective tradition of self-regulation.  Amateurs are expected to coordinate their use of frequencies.  (Nobody has any exclusive right to use any particular frequency.)  Coordination of many terrestrial stations, repeaters and beacons, for example, usually works well through IARU member national societies and local coordinating committees.

Coordinating satellites:  Amateur radio satellites present a special problem because satellites have global effect.  Only a global frequency coordination system can work. Uncoordinated satellites will cause harmful interference to stations around the world and receive interference from them — which could result in mission failure.

3.	IARU Coordination procedure:  
a)	   Frequency coordination for amateur radio satellites is provided by the IARU through its Satellite Advisor, a senior official appointed by the IARU Administrative Council, its top policymaking body.  The IARU Satellite Advisor is assisted by an Advisory Panel of qualified amateurs from all three IARU Regions.  (Similar to ITU Regions.)
b)	   It is a mandatory requirement for the IARU coordination that the licensing administration notifies the ITU with the selected frequency assignments/bands for the proposed satellite (ref RR Article 9, sub-section IA3). The licensing administration files the Advanced Publication Information (API) with ITU. This should preferably be done prior to the actual frequency coordination by IARU. As a response to this submission, the ITU will assign a special section number (API/A). This API/A special section number must be provided in field 1d of the Frequency Coordination Request form. If this information is not available when the IARU Frequency Coordination Request is filed, please provide the date that you submitted the API information to your administration. Usually an API special section publication appears within two to three months after its submission to ITU. It is important that you encourage your national administration to forward their notice to ITU as early as possible. 

Note that for the amateur satellite service, ITU offers this registration without any fee of cost recovery.

c)	   It is important that all satellites operating in the amateur satellite service are registered with ITU in order to obtain international recognition, something that demonstrates the relevance of the amateur satellite service and protects its frequency allocations. IARU therefore strongly recommends that you work with your national administration and encourage them after the API submission to continue with the submission of the Notification form of notice of the satellite stations when they are brought into use (RR Article 11.2).  Assistance with the notification process is provided on the ITU web.

4.	Getting Help.
a)	Start by reading Amateur Radio Satellites, which is an IARU paper. You will find explanations and interpretations of Treaty provisions.  IARU satellite frequency coordination follows these interpretations.  Download the latest version from:  https://www.iaru.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/iarusatspec_rev15.7.pdf 
b)	Discuss your project with the national amateur radio society of your country and your national AMSAT organization, if there is one.  They may be able to assist you in a variety of ways. 
c)	Use information available on-line.
i.	For a list of national amateur radio societies (Member Societies of IARU), see: 	http://www.iaru.org/iaru-soc.html.

3 This applies to non-GSO amateur satellites only. For GSO satellites contact the IARU Satellite Advisor for further guidance. 
ii.  For a list of amateur satellite organizations, see: https://www.amsat.org/amsats-around-the-world/
iii.  A link budget spread sheet is at: http://www.amsatuk.me.uk/iaru/spreadsheet.htm 
iv.  Check frequencies of currently operating satellites at https://www.amsat.org/status/    Check on coordinated and other planned amateur satellites at: http://www.amsat.org.uk/iaru/.
v.  If you need help understanding the requirements or completing the coordination request, ask the Satellite Advisor or a Panel Member.

5.	When to make the frequency coordination request.  Make your frequency coordination request as far in advance as possible.  Remember, coordination takes account of your own needs and the needs of others.  Receiving coordination early enough makes design and construction easier and less expensive.  In any event, be sure to make your request while it is still possible to change operating frequencies in response to the Satellite Advisor’s recommendations. A good moment to submit your coordination request would be right after you have done your preliminary Design Review.

6.	Who makes the frequency coordination request?  The prospective space station licensee must make the coordination request, as that person will be responsible for space station transmitter operations.

7.	Where to send your frequency coordination request.  Send frequency coordination requests to the IARU Satellite Advisor by e-mail to satcoord@iaru.org. You should get an acknowledgement that the request has been received within a week.

8.	What will happen?  The IARU Satellite Advisor will make recommendations to the licensee concerning plans based upon all available information and advice from the Satellite Advisory Panel.  His goal is to help you and your project to succeed.  The current status of your request will be published through the link at http://www.amsat.org.uk/iaru.  When the process is complete, the licensee will receive a coordination letter with detailed information. Visit also http://www.iaru.org for information about the IARU and its activities.
